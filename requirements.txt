QA WEB_Test task

Using Selenium WebDriver, please do the following:
• Open https://careers.veeam.com/vacancies and maximize the browser window. DONE

• Then, using the jobs filter on the page, count the number of Sales positions in two locations:
- USA, Texas, Austin
- Romania, Bucharest

• You are expected to count positions by choosing the correct filter settings, pressing search
button and counting blocks that represent open positions.

• Compare the number of positions with the expected result for each location.


Notes:
It would be a good idea to parametrize the values of input parameters and the expected job
number so that the code could be used with various parameter sets.
You can use a browser of your choice.

Please do not use ChatGPT or similar tools.
